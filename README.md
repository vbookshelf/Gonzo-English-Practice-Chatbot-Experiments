# Gonzo English Teacher Chatbot Experiments
My experiments with Gonzo, a ChatGPT powered chatbot web app that helps people learn english through conversation.

<br>

## How it works
- The idea is to create a chat roleplay scenario to make the experience more engaging for the user. For example, to help Thai people practice english the chatbot emulates an alien from Mars on holiday in Thailand.
- The chatbot responds both in English and in the user's first language.
- If the user has made any spelling or grammar errors in their message, the chatbot also outputs a corrected version of the user's message.
