### Objective

- Add code to handle the condition where the model output is not json.
- Add a first language selector.
- Removed and html from the output of the first api. 
  
### Notes
- When the output is not json then the app simply displays the response from the first api, without and correction or translation.
- The user can now choose from several first languages. The chatbot's response will be translated into this first language.
