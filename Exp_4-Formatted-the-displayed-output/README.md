## Exp_4 - Formatted the displayed output
<br>

### Objective
- Format the chatbot's message so that it looks good when shown to the user.

### Notes
- The model's json string output needs to be added to the message list (conversation memory). If the json string is not appended then the model will not consistently output in the json format.
- The model is not detecting some grammar errors.
- The model is asking "How can I help you?" like an assistant. This is not good in a roleplay scenario.
